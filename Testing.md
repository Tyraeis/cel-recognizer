# Testing

## Unit Tests
  For the video player, we tested a basic program that would play a selected video. We also tested a play button that would 
  play and pause the video when selected. We also tested the progress bar of the video, making sure it was accurate to where
  in the video it was. We tested if we could also upload an image and make sure it was recognized properly. We also made sure 
  the progress bar's color could be updated by the program for highlighting key aspects of the program.

## System Tests
  We made sure that all the parts worked together. The program recognized the image and the video uploaded by the user, ran
  the image recognition portions of the code, and then updated the progress bar accordingly. We made sure that selecting a point
  in the video that our program said was likely to be a match was and that a point that wasn't likely to be a match wasn't.

## Acceptance Tests
  Our sponsor wanted our program to be easy to deploy and user friendly. We tested this by downloading from this repository, making
  sure that we had the proper requirements to run it, and only using the files from this repository, ran the program and made sure it
  worked properly and was easy to use.
