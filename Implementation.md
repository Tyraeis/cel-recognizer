#Implementation

This program uses Python to recognize an image in a given video 
by comparing several key elements present in the image and a frame
of the video. This comparison is handled automatically by the program
and displays a video editor with key parts highlighted in the video's 
progress bar. The user has to select a video and an image to search for 
and the Python program takes care of the rest. All the required packages 
are found in README.md.
